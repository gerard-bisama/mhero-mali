## iHRIS Health Workforce Information Systems Software


iHRIS, IntraHealth International's free, open source software, helps 
countries around the world track and manage their health workforce data 
to improve access to services. Countries use it to capture and maintain 
high-quality information for health workforce planning, management, 
regulation, and training.

iHRIS is built on a flexible framework that allows ministries of health, 
professional councils, and health service delivery organizations to adapt 
applications for a wide variety of uses. Developed in collaboration with 
national stakeholders beginning in 2005, with support from USAID, iHRIS 
is used in more than 20 countries to manage over a million health worker 
records at a potential cost savings of over $275 million when compared 
to commercial software.
